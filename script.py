# Read all the files with an extension .hml
# put them into a json object with filename as key and content of the file as the value.
# print this json in a file called "files.json"

# format it to be like artifact

# upload to promptql project

# I'll paste the permissions docs page. I'll give one example of a permission I want to add. Then I'll say, go do this for every file. Add permission rules that make sense. Do this only if the hml object is of kind: Model or kind: Command

# Download the json artifact

# use python script to replace all the files on my disk with file contents from json artifact

# PromptQL Filesystem example

Only works locally - because needs filesystem access.
All write actions will ask for approval. But please approve carefully!


## Instructions

- Clone the repo
- Replace the project with your own (delete the project entry in .hasura/context.yaml) and run `ddn project init`
- Build metadata: `ddn supergraph build local`
- Run the nodejs server without docker: `ddn run mynodejs` (because docker can't access filesystem)
- Run ddn locally: `ddn run docker-start`
- Head over to the local console and to PromptQL! `ddn console --local`
